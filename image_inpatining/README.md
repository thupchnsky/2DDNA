# Generative Image Inpainting

Please refer to the original github link for more information: https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting.

An open source framework for generative image inpainting task, with the support of [Contextual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) (CVPR 2018) and [Gated Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03589) (ICCV 2019 Oral).

## Run

0. Requirements:
    * Install python3.
    * Install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) (tested on Release 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0).
    * Install tensorflow toolkit [neuralgym](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/neuralgym) (run `pip install git+https://github.com/JiahuiYu/neuralgym`).
1. Training:
    * Prepare training images filelist and shuffle it ([example](https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting/issues/15)).
    * Modify [inpaint.yml](/inpaint.yml) to set DATA_FLIST, LOG_DIR, IMG_SHAPES and other parameters.
    * Run `python train.py`.
2. Resume training:
    * Modify MODEL_RESTORE flag in [inpaint.yml](/inpaint.yml). E.g., MODEL_RESTORE: 20180115220926508503_places2_model.
    * Run `python train.py`.
3. Testing:
    * Run `python test.py --image examples/input.png --mask examples/mask.png --output examples/output.png --checkpoint model_logs/your_model_dir`.

## Pretrained models

[Places2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7Irxm3HSHGvp546hZdAZwuNmhLUVcjO?usp=sharing) | [CelebA-HQ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uvcDgMer-4hgWlm6_G9xjvEQGP8neW15?usp=sharing)

Download the model dirs and put it under `model_logs/` (rename `checkpoint.txt` to `checkpoint` because google drive automatically add ext after download). Run testing or resume training as described above. All models are trained with images of resolution 256x256 and largest hole size 128x128, above which the results may be deteriorated.

**Note:** Please make sure the mask file completely cover the masks in input file. You may check it with saving a new image to visualize `cv2.imwrite('new.png', img - mask)`.

## TensorBoard

Visualization on [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard) for training and validation is supported. Run `tensorboard --logdir model_logs --port 6006` to view training progress.
